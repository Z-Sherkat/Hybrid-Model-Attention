# Hybrid-Model-Attention

A Self-Attention-Based LSTM, Bi-LSTM, CNN-LSTM and CNN-Bi-LSTM Model for SOC estimation.

Code Description:

 •	N10deg--->create the models for N10 degree
 
 •	0deg--->create the models for zero degree
 
 •	10deg--->create the models for 10 degree
 
 •	25deg--->create the models for 25 degree

# Dataset

The McMaster data set includes data of a series of tests carried out at six ambient temperatures
(40deg, 25deg, 10deg, 0deg, −10deg, and −20deg). The considered McMaster data set was collected from 
a single 3 Ah LG Chem INR18650HG2 NMC cell. Its specifications are listed in Table 1. The data set includes
the information on four discharges of automotive industry standard driving cycles: US06, LA92, UDDS, and HWFET,
as well as eight additional mix drive cycles with associated charge cycles.

The dataset encompasses a series of tests at four ambient temperatures is available here: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/cp3473x7xv/3
